# Financial-Statement-Scraper<br>

*Project Abstract*<br>
This project is an AI-powered automation agent that streamlines and standardizes key business processes for small and midsize businesses (SMBs). Our core goal is to prepare SMB owners—especially Baby Boomers—for mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The agent automates tasks such as data cleanup, documentation generation, process mapping, and readiness assessment, enabling business owners to focus on growth rather than administrative burden.<br>

*Business Relevance*<br>
We support the transition of SMBs from retiring Boomers to next-generation owners. By automating tedious and complex operational tasks, we expedite wealth transfer and make SMBs M&A-ready even if private equity is the final goal. The platform simplifies internal processes, ensures clean and audit-ready data, supports valuation workflows, and creates deliverables that appeal to acquirers or PE firms. This directly ties into your mission of carrying forward downward-generation wealth transfer via technology-enabled M&A automation.<br>

*How to Use*<br>
-> Clone the repository and install required dependencies (see Requirements below).<br>
-> Enter business data inputs: financial documents, operational workflows, tax records, employee and vendor info.<br>
-> Run the agent: AI modules will analyze, clean, standardize, and generate required M&A outputs (e.g. valuation summaries, process flow charts, due diligence documentation).<br>
-> Review the generated artifacts, fix flagged issues, and iterate until the business is ready for a transaction.<br>

*Tech Stack*<br>
-> Main languages: Python (backend orchestration), JavaScript/Node.js if a frontend is included<br>
-> AI/ML components: GPT‑style language models via OpenAI API, plus templating and classification models<br>
-> Data handling: Pandas or similar for data cleaning and normalization<br>
-> Automation: CLI or simple web UI for step-by-step workflow<br>
-> Storage: Local JSON/CSV files or lightweight database (SQLite)<br>
-> Version control: Git, repository host GitHub<br>

*Warnings*<br>
-> This is an MVP focused on automation of basic, repeatable tasks. It is not a full-featured M&A due diligence suite.<br>
-> Sensitive business or financial information must be handled according to applicable privacy and compliance rules.<br>
-> AI outputs should be reviewed by a human before using them in actual M&A presentations or filings.<br>
-> Accuracy depends on input quality—if source documents are poor or incomplete, generated outputs may be erroneous.<br>

*Requirements*<br>
-> Python 3.10+<br>
-> Install dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
-> Access to OpenAI API credentials (for AI modules)<br>
-> Example dataset folder or company snapshot files (CSV, Excel, or JSON)<br>
-> Optional: Node.js 14+ if there is a frontend web UI component<br>
